Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Increasing simulations improves prediction accuracy and reliability.
With fewer simulations, predictions are less reliable and prone to deviations.
Higher simulation numbers reduce incorrect predictions, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
Predictions around 100,000+ simulations are more likely accurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

the predictions stabilized and reached a reasonable level of accuracy after around 10000 simulations.
Beyond this point, the marginal improvement in accuracy may not justify
the additional time and cost required to run a larger number of simulations.
Therefore, based on the execution times given,
approximately 10000 simulations could be considered "good enough" in terms of balancing accuracy and cost.
